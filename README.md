# Overview - Real Estate Broke Site - Tessa Goldy

This is the front end of a real estate broker website built using older style React and Redux for state management. It uses the redux-saga library to make and handle asynchronous calls to the back end. The app leverages the react-bootstrap library for UI. The app includes APIs for authorized CRUD operations, authentication and access management (via OAuth), and simple/complex forms with custom validation. It uses the compound component pattern and the Styled Components library to style the components.
